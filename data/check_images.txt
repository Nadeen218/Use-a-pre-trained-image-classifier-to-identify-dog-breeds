Answer: all of model have simmilar performs in this trial with 100% correct classification like all dogs breed classified correctly and the another whos not dogs classified correctly too , I conseder VGG to be the best model because its known for its consistently achieving the highest accuracy in dog breed classification across larger datasets, as shown in the project reference results
